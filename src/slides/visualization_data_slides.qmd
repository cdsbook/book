## Dataframes

In R, a table of data is called a *dataframe*.

Dataframes can be assigned to variables. Let's image we have this simple table stored in a variable called `df`:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x_coords = c(1,3), y_coords = c(2,4))
df
```

::: notes
Each row is an observation of some thing.

## Dataframe columns

* Columns contain a measurement of some attribute.
* Columns are also called variables.
* In R, a column is just a vector.

We can extract a column using the `$` operator:

```{r}
#| echo: true
df$x_coords
```

## Types of variable: continuous

## Types of variable: discrete

## Types of variable: categorical


```{r outro}
#| echo: FALSE
#| results: "asis"
source("common_end_slide.R")
```
