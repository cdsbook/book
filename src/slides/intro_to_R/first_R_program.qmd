## Running R code in the *Console*

TODO: Screenshot or video of RStudio.

::: {.notes}
If you have installed RStudio, then when you open the software you will see that it contains a pane called the *Console*. This allows us to write and run R code from within RStudio.

The top of the Console starts with some information about the version of R that you are running. Below that is a greater-than symbol, with a blinking cursor. We call this the prompt, and we can write code after it.

<Write some code, e.g. 2+2>

We can run a line of R code in the Console by pressing Enter on our keyboards when we have reached the end of the line.

## What happens when you run code?

R will then interpret the code that you have written and convert it into electrical signals that your computer can understand.

It will then convert the result of those computer signals back into an output that you can understand, and display it on your screen.

## Your first program

TODO: Video of Hello, world in RStudio goes here.

::: {.notes}
We are now ready to write our first computer program. Many years ago, a famous programming textbook was published which had a first program called "Hello, world", and it now a tradition to begin with a similar program when learning any new programming language.

The "Hello, world" program is very simple. When the computer runs the program, it will simply print out the words "hello" and "world".

For example, here's how we could run this program in the Console from within RStudio.

First we are going to type in a command called `print()`. We will talk more about this in a moment, but for now, note that we need to add opening and closing parentheses immediately after the word print.

Inside the parentheses, we add some opening and closing quotation marks, and then inside those we type the words "hello" and "world".

When we're done, we can press the Enter key on our keyboard. R will immediately run this line of code. The print command that we have used here displays the words we supplied immediately below the line of code.
