This video will introduce you to the importance of visualization in data science, and how it can be used effectively (or ineffectively).

> A picture is worth thousand words...

...and a good graph is clearer than a table of data.

In pre-modern times, our ancestors did not have to worry about tables of data (or words). But they did have to interpret patterns in what they saw.

We are stuck with the same brains, and so while a column of numbers doesn't mean much, if we can transform that column into a picture then patterns can become much clearer.

Example: Challenger Disaster

In 1985 the 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tufte_data <- tibble(
  flight = c("51-C", "41-B", "61-C", "41-C", "1", "6", "51-A", "51-D", "5", "3", "2", "9", "41-D", "51-G", "7", "8", "51-B", "61-A", "51-I", "61-B", "41-G", "51-J", "4", "51-F"),
  temperature = c(51,57,58,63,66,67,67,67,68,69,70,70,70,70,72,73,75,76,76,76,78,79,80,81),
  damage = c(11,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0)
)
tufte_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(temperature, damage)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  xlim(20,90)
```


Pictures of data are called "graphs".

There are many ways that we can visualize the same data. Some of these ways *may* be good, but many of them *will* be bad.
