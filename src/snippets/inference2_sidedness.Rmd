### 1 or 2?

<!--
Questions to add:
* Writing alternative hypotheses for 1 and 2 sides
* Which parameter in code specifies order of diff calculation -> order
* Examples of whether to use 1 or 2 sided.
* Calculating p-value
  * 1 sided left and right
  * 2 sided
-->

```{r alt_hypothesis_specification-quiz, eval=is_tutorial}
question(
  "You want to conduct a *two-sided* hypothesis test on data from an experiment comparing whether a patient survive a disease after receiving a drug or a placebo. What is your alternative hypothesis?",
  answer("The difference in proportions of patients who survive is significantly different between drug and placebo groups.", correct = TRUE, message = "In a two-sided test, the alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference, regardless of direction (i.e. whether the difference is positive or negative is unimportant)."),
  answer("The difference in means of patients who survive is significantly different between drug and placebo groups."),
  answer("The difference in means of patients who survive is significantly greater in the drug group than the placebo group."),
  answer("The difference in proportions of patients who survive is significantly greater in the drug group than the placebo group."),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
