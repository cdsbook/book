## Nearly normal residuals

<!-- Related to conditional means. Plot the normal variation along the model line. -->

The best linear model is the one that has the smallest sum of the squared residuals. We don't need to worry too much about the mathematics behind this - however, you should be aware that the math does make the simplifying assumption that the residuals have a *normal* distribution (more or less).

The normal distribution is a bell-shaped distribution:

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("images/Normal_Distribution_NIST.gif") -->
<!-- ``` -->

We can plot a histogram of the residuals and see if that has a (more or less) normal distribution. However, it is often hard to interpret the "normality" of a histogram just by looking at it, since there are many different types of unimodal symmetric distribution.

Instead, a much better method is to create a Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot. This video from Stat Quest gives an excellent overview of what a Q-Q plot is:

Q-Q plots are so useful that the `ggplot2` package already contains geom functions for creating them.

We can use the `diamonds_plus_preds` data frame to create a Q-Q plot (with both points and a reference line):

```{r diamonds-qqplot-example, echo = TRUE}
diamonds_plus_preds %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_qq(mapping = aes(sample = .resid))+
  geom_qq_line(mapping = aes(sample = .resid))
```

```{r qqplot_question, eval=is_tutorial, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "Does this model satisfy the assumption of nearly-normal residuals?",
  answer("Yes"),
  answer("No", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Can't say one way or the other"),
  incorrect = "To satisfy this assumption, the majority of the points should fall very close to the line."
  )
```
