The fourth (and final) assumption of the linear model is that all the observations (data points) were generated *independently*.

We will not worry to much about this assumption in this course, as the datasets we give you will have independent observations (for the most part).

But what does it mean for observations to be *non-independent*?

Consider the stock market: we could have a dataset that contains measurements of a company's stock price at the end of each day. However these observations are not independent. A stock price will rise or fall, but this change will be *from the previous observation*. I.e. if the stock ends day 1 at 100, it will probably end day 2 pretty close to 100. Therefore, the data points are not independent.

For comparison, think about measuring the height of all the students in this class: one student's height does not significantly affect an other's, so these observations are all independent.
