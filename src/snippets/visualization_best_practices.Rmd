TODO: show some good and bad graphs to illustrate these points.

1. Communicate as much information as possible with as little ink as possible

  * White space is good
  * Excessive use of color is bad.
  * Fun and artistic infographics often obscure the actual data.

2. Create graphs that meet the expectations of the viewer, and be explicit when you do something different.

  * Axis ranges (start at 0, or be clear if not. Don't start elsewhere to exaggerate a small difference.)
  * Direction of data on axis. (left to right, and bottom to top)
  * Time on x-axis
  * Scales on subplots

3. Make comparisons easy.

  * Lengths, not areas.
  * Side-by-side comparisons - don't make people move things mentally to see how they are different.
  
4. Label your graphs.

5. Avoid 3D graphs like the plague.
