R is an *interpreted programming language*.

That is a fancy way of saying that R runs (i.e. "interprets") every line of code one at a time.

So far we have written a line of code and then run it. In a couple of exercises you may have run multiple lines of code where one line depended on a result from a previous line. However, R completely finished running the first line before moving onto the next one.

When R *interprets* a line of code, it figures out how to convert your human-readable code into computer-readable instructions (which are a series of 0s and 1s, since a computer is basically a bunch of wires that can either have an electrical current flowing down them (which we denote as 1) or not (0)).

Because R is interpreted line-by-line, it is an ideal programming language for exploring and analyzing scientific data, where we typically figure out what to do next as we go along!

We will soon be learning how to write multiple lines of R code in a file and then run them from the file. However, even when R runs code from a file, it still figures out how to run it one line at a time.

> **Compiled Programming Languages**
>
> Not every programming language is interpreted like R. Some are *compiled*. 
>
> This means that you write all your code in a file, and then turn all of it into computer-readable instructions at once. This step is called *compilation* and can take a long time (up to hours for large programs in some languages!). It is typically slower to write programs in a compiled language because of this extra step.

> The main advantage of a compiled programming language is that your computer can figure out how to optimize all the lines of code so that they run extremely fast.
>
> Famous examples of compiled programming languages are Java and C++.
