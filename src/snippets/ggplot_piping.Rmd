One advantage of `ggplot()` over `qplot()` is that we can pipe a dataframe to `ggplot()` because the first parameter of ggplot() is the dataset to be used.

So instead of explicity passing the `starwars` dataframe to the `data` parameter:

```r
ggplot(data = starwars) + ...
```

...we could write this:

```r
starwars %>%
  ggplot() + ...
```

This might not seem like much, but it does mean that we can put the graphing functions at the end of a series of piped functions that transform and wrangle our dataset, for example:

```r
some_dataset %>%
  mutate(...) %>%
  filter(...) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_FUNCTION(...)
```
