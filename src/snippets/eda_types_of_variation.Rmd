Hopefully you are now convinced why graphing data is important. But what type of graphs should you create?

The rest of this tutorial will go through different types of graphs, but here are some general concepts to bear in mind:

* We can broadly divide EDA into two types: univariate and multivariate

  * Univariate, or "one variable", analysis looks at the **variation** within a single variable's values. Our goal here is to understand the distribution of this variable.
  
  * Multivariate (i.e. "many variables") refers to analysis of 2 or more variables where we want to examine the **covariance** between variables. In other words, how does one variable change in response to changes in another.

* As a general principle, you should do univariate EDA first before multivariate EDA.

* We have put together a flow chart to help you pick the right type of graph for particular types of data and analysis goals: [available as a PDF here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zsedQ9kHFtxhFE3R99PQ1a_yTTamJu3e/view?usp=sharing).
