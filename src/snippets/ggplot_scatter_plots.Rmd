Hopefully you are beginning to see that the `ggplot()` syntax uses many of the same parameters as `qplot()`, just in different places.

We can create a scatter plot by switching to a geom function called `geom_point()` and passing an additional column to the `aes()` function to go on the `y` axis:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)
  )
```
