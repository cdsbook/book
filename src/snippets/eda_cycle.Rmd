As a reminder, we usually want to *start with univariate analysis* of each variable separately. Programs and data are both complicated, so it is always a good idea to start small and simple, and add in complexity gradually.

If we do the opposite and start complicated, it is easy to make small mistakes and assumptions which might make our final conclusions wrong!
