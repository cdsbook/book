Exploratory data analysis, or **EDA** for short, is a vague, hard-to-define concept... but is also the activity that will occupy much of your time as a data scientist.

Here's the problem:

* When you first get a dataset, you don't know very much about it. You probably choose the dataset because you thought it might help you solve a particular problem, but you don't know how (or if) the data can help you do that, or what other nuances might be present in the dataset.

* So, the first step is to do a little digging: open the data up, and:

  1. Plot a few basic graphs (EDA is mostly done with graphs because they make it very easy to spot patterns).
  
  2. Calculate some simple statistics (e.g. averages and ranges)

* This basic analysis will probably give you some ideas about the data. You'll probably spot some patterns that bear further investigation, or maybe some issues that you'll need to address.

* How do you do this? More analysis, visualization, and general experimentation, which in turn will reveal more potential patterns, and so the cycle continues...

Your end goal is to find some interesting questions in the dataset that deserve some kind of follow-up.

Does this seem all seem vague and open-ended? That's because it is fundamentally a creative activity. There's no one "right way" to create a painting or a book. Exploratory data analysis is the same. And just like those other creative activities, the way to get better is to practice.
