An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot. This combines aspects of the histogram and boxplot into a single graph.

The code for a violin plot is almost identical to the code or a boxplot - we just use the `geom_violin()` geom function:



```{r, echo=TRUE}
diamonds %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = "price", y = price))
```
