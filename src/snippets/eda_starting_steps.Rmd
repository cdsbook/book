When you begin EDA on a dataset, it's a good idea to proceed in the following order:

1. Understand why you are exploring the data.

2. Make sure you understand the dataset.

  i. Load the data and check the dataset's documentation.

  ii. Look at the first and last rows of your dataframe.

  iii. Make sure the data makes sense.

3. Start the EDA cycle.
