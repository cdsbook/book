### A recap

By now you are familiar with the idea that in R we have **values** and **variables**. We can write something like:

```r
x <- 2
```

to store the *value* 2 in the *variable* `x`. We do so using the **assignment operator**, `<-`.

This allows us to use a variable such as `x` in future lines of code. When that future code is run, the variable will be replaced with its value, e.g.

```r
x + 3
```

becomes

```r
2 + 3
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
render_blank_answer(
"What value is assigned to `x` after the following lines of R code have run?

    x <- 2 + 2
    y <- 5
    x <- x / y
",
  c("0.8"),
  explanation = "The final line executes the expression on the right of the assignment operator first, retrieving the values of `x` and `y` that we have assigned in the earlier lines (`4` and `5`). The result of that expression, $\\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$ , is then assigned to `x`, overwriting the previous value that was stored in `x`."
)
```
