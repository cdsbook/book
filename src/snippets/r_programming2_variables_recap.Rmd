### A recap

By now you are familiar with the idea that in R we have **values** and **variables**. We can write something like:

```r
x <- 2
```

to store the *value* 2 in the *variable* `x`. We do so using the **assignment operator**, `<-`.

This allows us to use a variable such as `x` in future lines of code. When that future code is run, the variable will be replaced with its value, e.g.

```r
x + 3
```

becomes

```r
2 + 3
```
