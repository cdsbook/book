> Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying distribution of probability. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.

What does the above definition mean in simple terms?

The world around us is an uncertain, random place. Take the heights of the students in this class: you all have a wide range of heights - some taller, some shorter. 

We could plot a histogram of your heights - we would call this graph a *distribution* of your heights, and we could *infer* various things about it, e.g. the mean.

This process of going from raw measurements (e.g. of heights) to properties of the distribution that those measurements came from is called *statistical inference*.
