## What is a model

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_intro.Rmd >}}


{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_correlation_not_causation.Rmd >}}

<!-- TODO: 

- DONE: ~~add examples of linear correlations vs. nonlinear, ~~
- vs pure randomness (also, show how randomness is more clumpy that we normally think of).

-->


## Creating models in R

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_lm_video.Rmd >}}


### Let's create a linear model

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_fitting_video.Rmd >}}

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_lm_usage.Rmd >}}


### Your model's coefficients

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_coefficients.Rmd >}}

<!-- 
TODO: use coef() function to get model coefficients, and then inline code if you want to talk about them in the text as opposed to manually writing in the number - this helps to avoid typos and errors. 
-->


### Categorical explanatory variables


### More than one explanatory variable

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_multiple_explanatory_variables.Rmd >}}

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_lm_multiple_regression.Rmd >}}

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_diamonds_multiple_example.Rmd >}}


### $R^2$: how good is your model?

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_rsquared.Rmd >}}


### What's a good $R^2$?

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_rsquared_goodness.Rmd >}}


## Testing our assumptions


### Assumptions of the linear model

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_assumptions_overview.Rmd >}}


### Linearity

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_assumptions_linearity.Rmd >}}


### Constant variability of residuals

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_assumptions_constant_variability.Rmd >}}


### Nearly normal residuals

{{< include ../../src/snippets/modeling_basic_assumptions_normal_residuals.Rmd >}}

<!--
Use dot plot histogram to help explain how a QQ plot is generated (along with a box plot, since that shows quartiles). Compare with density plot of normal distribution.

Plot the graph of the true residual distribution against one axis of the QQ-plot and the normal distribution along the other. Show how a point at (e.g.) the 25th % falls within each distribution.

Show how different skews/shapes manifest as different QQ-plots.
-->

### Independent observations
