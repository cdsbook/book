TODO:
- section on categorical explanatory variables?
- section on confounding (builds on previous tutorial's correlation vs causation)

- scaling variables? polynomial terms?

## Confidence intervals for models

* Use geom_smooth with method="lm" and show the se
  * visualizing models and trend lines in general - always show the underlying data points to avoid misleading -> the geom_smooth() function would be a good place to bring this up, since it's where the mistake usually happens

## Non-linear response variables

aka. generalized linear models

## Other residuals types

maybe...?
