### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_intro.Rmd >}}


### Types of variation to explore

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_types_of_variation.Rmd >}}


## Starting EDA

### A "first steps" EDA checklist

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_checklist.Rmd >}}


### Formulate your question

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_questions.Rmd >}}


### Load the data and read the documentation

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_load_data.Rmd >}}


### Get an overview of the data

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_glimpse.Rmd >}}


### Look at the first and last rows of your dataframe

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_head_tail.Rmd >}}


### Make sure that the data makes sense

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_sanity_check.Rmd >}}


### Start the EDA cycle

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_cycle.Rmd >}}


## Univariate variation

### Non-graphical methods (i.e. summary statistics)

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_summary_statistics_univariate.Rmd >}}


### Graphical analysis of `carat`

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_carat_variation.Rmd >}}


### `price` visualization

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_price_variation_boxplot.Rmd >}}


### Violin plots

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_violin_plot.Rmd >}}


## Multivariate covariation

When we have multiple variables we want to understand how their variation is related: this is called **covariation**.

### Non-graphical (i.e. summary statistics)
See:
- NIST handbook: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35.htm
- Section 4.4: https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~hseltman/309/Book/chapter4.pdf
- mathematical covariance (and relationship to R-squared) + graphical interpretation with heat map (correlation plot)
-->

### Co-variation with summary statistics

__TODO__

### Graphical

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_covariation_scatter_plot.Rmd >}}


### Coloring and faceting by categorical variables

__TODO__

<!--

TODO:
Faceting... since its in the quiz...

## Your turn

### Do some EDA

{{< include ../../src/snippets/eda_outro.Rmd >}}
