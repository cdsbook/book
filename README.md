# Introduction to Computational and Data Sciences for Scientists (with R)

_Book and Tutorials_

## Project structure

The book and tutorials share the same source .Rmd files in the `src` directory.

Base content is in the `src/snippets` directory. Then chapter/tutorial files in the `src/book` and `src/tutorials` folders convert those into book chapters and interactive tutorials.
